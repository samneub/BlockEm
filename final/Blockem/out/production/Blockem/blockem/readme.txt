Goal
The player's goal in this game is to play all (or as many as they can)
of their 21 pieces (seen in the long grid at the bottom of the game.)
Each piece is worth the same number of points, as squares that make it up (1-5).
Each player starts with 89 points, when a piece is played the points of that piece
are subtracted from a player's points. The player(s) with the lowest score wins the game.

Rules:
Each player gets to place one piece per turn.
The first piece must be played so that at least one square of the piece is a corner square in the board.
After the first turn, subsequent pieces must be played so that at least one square of the new piece
touches at least one corner of one of your already played pieces. Pieces you play can not touch the
sides of one of your pieces, but it may touch the sides of other players' pieces.
Pieces are played by clicking on squares on the game board to form one of the pieces that you have (seen in
the repository of pieces at the bottom of the screen). Pieces from this repository can be played at any rotation or
flip of the piece. You can click squares again to deselect them.
One you are finished player your piece, click finish turn and the turn will move to the next player. If the piece you
have played is invalid (either not a actual piece, not a piece that you have any more - each piece can only
be played once-, or not at a valid location in the board), the piece will be removed and you will have to play a
different piece. If the piece is valid it will be removed from your repository of pieces that you can play.
If you can no longer play a piece you can click pass and the turn will move to the next player. Once you pass you will
no longer be able to play pieces on the board.
Once all four players have passed, the game ends.

The player(s) with the lowest score will win the game.
